# Module 2 Assignment: Salary Function 

## Overview
This project processes employee salary data using Python and R to perform data analysis and file handling tasks. The implementation includes importing data, searching for employee details, exporting data to CSV, zipping files, and unzipping files in R.

## Features
1. **Import Salary Data**: Loads `Total.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Employee Details Function**: A Python function to search for an employee's details by name.
3. **Dictionary Processing**: Converts salary data into a dictionary for easy access.
4. **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling for data issues and invalid inputs.
5. **Export to CSV and Zip**: Exports employee details to a CSV file and compresses it into a zip file.
6. **R Script for Unzipping**: Unzips the compressed folder and displays the contents in R.

## How to Run the Project

### Python Instructions
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Libraries: `pandas`, `csv`, `os`, `zipfile`
- Open 'Ruth_Nwawuzoh_BAN6420_Module_2_Assignment_Python_Code.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run all the cells in the notebook to:
- Import the Total.csv file.
- Process salary data into a dictionary.
- Export specific employee details to a zipped folder named Employee Profile.zip.

### R Instructions
- R 4.0 or higher
- Utilities Package: `utils` (pre-installed in most R setups)
- Ensure the file Employee Profile.zip is in the same directory as `Ruth_Nwawuzoh_BAN6420_Module_2_Assignment_R_Code.R`.
- Open `Ruth_Nwawuzoh_BAN6420_Module_2_Assignment_R_Code.R` in RStudio or any R environment.
- Run the script to unzip and display the content of the exported file.
